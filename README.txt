It is a re-implementation with different features.This package contains the source code for training and evaluation of the Conditional Regression Forest.Additional to the source code you can find pretrained trees for head pose estimationand also for facial feature detection. ___ BUILDING This framework needs the open source computer vision library OpenCV and boost.1) set the path to OpenCV and Boost the Makefile2) make all (compiling the source code)3) make clearTested with the following version of the third party lib:- OpenCV 2.3.X- Boost 1.47.0 + Boost 1.46.1Known problems:- The boost library can be build in different ways.   Sometimes the boost shared libs have the ending '-mt' and sometimes they don't.  Please fix the makefile according to your version of boost.Tested on the following operation system:- MacOS 10.7.4- ubuntu 12.04 LTS- Debian 2.30.2___ DEMO APPLICATIONRunning the demo application using the pretrained trees is easy.Just run the application 'FaceForest':./FaceForest 0 data/config_ffd.txt data/config_headpose.txt data/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xmlyou need to set 4 flags:  - mode (0==training, 1==evaluate) - path to ffd config file - path to headpose config file - path to face cascade
